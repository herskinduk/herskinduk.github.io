title: "SUG notes: Automatic Sitecore Model Generation"
---

I presented my [model generation concept](/blog/2012/03/automatic-sitecore-model-generation) at this months Sitecore User Group in London and Bristol. For the benefit of everyone who attended I have put together a couple of links:

*   [My slides](http://static1.herskind.co.uk/%5Epub=NjM0NzAyMTEzNjYwMDAwMDAw/~/media/Files/sug/AutomaticModelGen.ashx) (if you saw the presentation in London - checkout slide no 8, it deals with the issue raised by [Jason Bert](http://twitter.com/Maynards1337) of not getting compile errors from .aspx/.ascx files).
*   You can get the source code from [Sitecore's Github page](https://github.com/Sitecore/TDS-T4-Model-Generation). (if you are not into Git you can download a zip file with the source).
*   [Team Development for Sitecore](http://www.hhogdev.com/Products/Team-Development-for-Sitecore.aspx). This Visual Studio plugin is of course a pre-requisite for using this technique - you can get a 60 day trail if you want to try it out.
*   Also [Oleg Synch's blog](http://www.olegsych.com/2007/12/text-template-transformation-toolkit/) is a great starting point if you want to know more about the Text Template Transformation Toolkit (T4).

Thanks to everyone who turned up and listened. :)
