Great news today. The guys at [Hedgehog Development](http://www.hhogdev.com) has just announced that the upcoming version of TDS will have T4 code generation built in. Here is a sneak peak from Hedgehogs YouTube channel:

If you have read my [blog post on Automatic Sitecore Model Generation](/blog/2012/03/automatic-sitecore-model-generation) you see that it's a very similar workflow to the one described in the video. I'm very excited about trying out the code generation feature of TDS. It looks like TDS will give a better integration of code generation in the build process and let us focus on model design.

I think that model generation for Sitecore is the way forward. What do you think?
