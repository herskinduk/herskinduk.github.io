title: Sitecore Most Valuable Professionals 2011
---

Sitecore announced the Sitecore MVPs for 2011 in a [press release](http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/sitecore-recognizes-exceptional-technical-community-leaders-from-around-the-world-1641616.htm) today. I'm honoured&nbsp;to be selected for the MVP program for a second time and hope that it will be a constructive two years ahead where we can make Sitecore even better. Here is an excerpt from the press release:

> "MVPs are technology experts who inspire others to learn and grow through active participation in the Sitecore technical community," said Lars Nielsen, senior vice president, technical marketing, Sitecore. "MVPs are not just about evangelizing Sitecore. They are passionate about improving technology and driving innovation and sharing their knowledge and real-world experiences at user groups, on blogs and on social channels. This year's prestigious list represents individuals who share the same passion for technology and a willingness to help others innovate and advance the use of Web technology. It's my pleasure to recognize their demonstrated commitment to the technology community worldwide."
