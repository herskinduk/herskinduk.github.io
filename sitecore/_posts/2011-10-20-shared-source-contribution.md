I recently did a post on integrating the [Image Cropper module](http://trac.sitecore.net/ImageCropper) seamlessly with the sc:image control. I am happy to announce that this additional functionality is now part of the module on Sitecore Shared Source and that I am now&nbsp;[officially a Shared Source contributor](http://trac.sitecore.net/ImageCropper/changeset/5) :)

Thanks to&nbsp;Julian Gilchrist from Igloo who initially contributed the ImageCropper and to our very helpful Shared Source Coordinator Jimmie Overby.
