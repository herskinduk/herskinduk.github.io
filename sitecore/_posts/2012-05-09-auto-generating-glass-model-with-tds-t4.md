I just read a great blog post by [Mike Edwards](https://twitter.com/#!/mikeedwards83) on using the [T4/TDS auto-generation framework](/blog/2012/03/automatic-sitecore-model-generation) to generate a Glass model for Sitecore. This example really shows how&nbsp;versatile&nbsp;the concept is and how it can be used to generate any model for Sitecore<!--more-->:

Also: Hedgehog recently&nbsp;announced&nbsp;that TDS v4 will have support for T4 code generation - so hopefully we can soon say bye bye to the clunky post build batch script. As far as I know this version is scheduled to be released in the&nbsp;autumn.
