Today [Sitecore announced](http://www.sitecore.net/News/Press-releases/2009/Sitecore-MVPs.aspx) the Sitecore MVPs for 2009 and I&#39;m thoroughly chuffed to find my name on the list.

Here is an excerpt from the press release:
> “The Sitecore MVP program recognizes those exceptional technology
> community leaders who actively evangelize and share their CMS knowledge
> with the Sitecore community,” said Lars Fløe Nielsen, VP, Technical
> Marketing, Sitecore. “With the MVP awards we want to thank these
> individuals for helping Sitecore users maximize the potential of their
> CMS platform and for advancing the entire community.”
